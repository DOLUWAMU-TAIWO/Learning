# Resolving Python Package Installation in System-Managed Environments (Ubuntu 24.04+)

In modern Debian/Ubuntu systems, especially Ubuntu 24.04 and above, Python is managed as part of the system environment, and traditional use of `pip install` may lead to `externally-managed-environment` errors.

This document outlines how to resolve these issues to allow `Flask` and `GitPython` to be installed system-wide without using virtual environments (venv), which are often unsuitable for production systems or automation platforms like an IDP.

---

## Problem

Attempts to run:

```bash
pip install flask gitpython
```

Result in:

```
error: externally-managed-environment
...
```

This is due to Python being system-managed and enforcing package isolation to avoid conflicting with system packages.

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Install `Flask` via `pipx` (correct method for CLI apps)

```bash
sudo apt install pipx
pipx install flask
```

This ensures `flask` CLI is globally accessible without modifying system packages.

---

### 2. Install `GitPython` using `apt`

GitPython is a library (not a CLI app), so `pipx` is not appropriate. Instead:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-git
```

If not available or outdated, install it globally using `pip` with `--break-system-packages` (Ubuntu 24.04):

```bash
sudo pip3 install gitpython --break-system-packages
```

This overrides the external management policy.

---

### 3. Validate Installation

```bash
python3 -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
python3 -c "import git; print(git.__version__)"
```

---

## Result

You can now run Flask servers and clone Git repos using GitPython in a production-friendly, system-wide Python setup without virtual environments.

---

## Notes

- Avoid `venv` in system scripts or Flask apps that need to run on reboot or outside development.
- Use `--break-system-packages` only with awareness of risks (conflict with system updates).
