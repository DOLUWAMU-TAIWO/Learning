## ZenNest: The Infrastructure Layer for Real Estate in Nigeria

---

## 🔍 What Does "Infrastructure Layer" Mean?

To be the *infrastructure layer* in a sector means to be the **foundational system** that **other applications, companies, and services** depend on to function. You're not just a destination (like a marketplace), you're a **platform others build upon**.

**Examples in other domains:**
- 🏦 **Stripe** → Infrastructure for payments
- 📲 **Twilio** → Infrastructure for messaging & voice
- 🏡 **Avail (Zillow)** → Infrastructure for landlord SaaS
- 🏦 **Plaid** → Infrastructure for fintech & bank data
- 📦 **Shopify** → Infrastructure for eCommerce

---

## 🧱 What ZenNest Must Offer to Justify the Claim

To **factually call itself the infrastructure layer**, ZenNest must offer **6 core capability categories**, detailed below.

---

## 1. 🔗 Core Real Estate APIs & SDKs

> You must let third parties **build their own apps** or workflows using your system.

### Key APIs to expose:

- `POST /properties`: Create a property listing
- `GET /properties`: Search with filters (location, price, type, availability)
- `POST /bookings`: Book a rental or short let
- `POST /payments`: Initiate and track rent/shortlet payments
- `POST /tenants`: Create tenant profile
- `GET /documents`: Fetch leases, ID uploads
- `POST /notifications`: Send SMS, email, in-app messages

### SDKs:
- ✅ JavaScript SDK (for frontend portals)
- ✅ Mobile SDK (Flutter/React Native for agents/startups)
- ✅ Webhooks for rental events (e.g. payment received, tenant signed lease)

---

## 2. 🧠 Unified Identity & Property Graph

> Create the **“Plaid of Nigerian Real Estate”**: a canonical source of truth for people, places, and transactions.

### Data Models:

- **Property ID System** (canonical record of listings, verified by location)
  - `property_id`: Stable identifier
  - `geo_hash`, `LGA`, `postal_code`, etc.
  - Verified by GPS, photos, or CAC docs

- **Tenant Identity Graph**
  - `tenant_id`: UUID
  - Linked NIN, rental history, blacklists/whitelists
  - Lease and payment history

- **Landlord Profile**
  - Verified CAC docs (if corporate)
  - Portfolio visibility
  - Automated onboarding

### Use Cases:
- Other proptechs can pull verified identities and listings
- Banks can fetch lease/payment history for rent-to-own
- Insurance can price tenant risk

---

## 3. 💰 Payments, Escrow, and Compliance Layer

> Become the **“Stripe for real estate”**, handling trust and money movement.

### Features:

- ✅ **Naira-native Payments** (Paystack/Monnify)
  - Recurring rent debits
  - Refundable deposit handling
  - Shortlet advance payments

- ✅ **Escrow Holding** for:
  - Shortlet safety
  - Dispute resolution
  - Lease compliance

- ✅ **Payout Routing**
  - Agent commissions split
  - Management firm fee splits
  - Automated landlord disbursements

- ✅ **Compliance**:
  - Rent receipts auto-generated
  - Stamp duty integration (future)
  - Lease KYC workflow (NIN, CAC, TIN)

---

## 4. 🤖 AI/ML + RAG Infrastructure

> Not just features — **infrastructure** that others can plug into.

### RAG & AI Use Cases:

- **Property Search API** (Natural Language Search)
  - Input: `"3-bedroom with balcony near Yaba"` → structured filters
  - Uses embeddings + vector search

- **Price Estimation API**
  - Predicts fair market rent or sale price
  - Inputs: area, condition, past data

- **Smart Lease Assistant**
  - Auto-fill leases with verified info
  - Renders in PDF or HTML

- **AI Chatbot SDK**
  - Drop-in React/Flutter component for live chat
  - Uses GPT + RAG backend to answer:
    - “How do I renew my rent?”
    - “Can I get a house in Lekki for ₦700k?”
    - “How do I register as a landlord?”

---

## 5. 🛠 Developer Ecosystem

> You must provide tooling so **others build** on you.

### Essential Components:

- ✅ **Developer Portal**
  - API docs (OpenAPI format)
  - Live sandbox
  - App registration (API keys)

- ✅ **Webhook System**
  - E.g.:
    - `onLeaseSigned`
    - `onPaymentConfirmed`
    - `onBookingCancelled`

- ✅ **OAuth2 Layer**
  - Tenant/landlord single sign-on
  - Third-party access control (scopes)

- ✅ **CLI Tooling**
  - ZenNest CLI to push listings, sync data
  - Ideal for large-scale brokerages, PM firms

---

## 6. 🏛️ Government & Legal Interfaces (Optional but Differentiating)

> Offer **state-level integrations** that make you the gateway to legality.

### Future Capabilities:

- ✅ CAC/Corporate Verification API
- ✅ LASRRA or NIN lookup API
- ✅ Local LGA rent control schema
- ✅ Automatic eStamp generation (Nigeria’s Stamp Duty)
- ✅ Legal template generation (Tenancy Agreements)

> These will **lock in trust** from agents, investors, proptechs, and regulators.

## 🎯 Summary

**ZenNest can credibly claim to be “the infrastructure layer behind real estate in Nigeria” if:**

✅ It exposes **programmatic APIs** for real estate operations  
✅ It allows **others to build on it** (agents, startups, PMs, etc.)  
✅ It handles **rent payments, shortlet booking, and escrow**  
✅ It offers **KYC, lease, tenant, and property identity graphs**  
✅ It delivers **AI models and assistant interfaces**  
✅ It becomes **the trust layer** for banks, regulators, and renters  

> Until then, ZenNest is a platform. But with this roadmap, it becomes *infrastructure*.

- [ ] Build API docs and sandbox (e.g. Swagger UI or Postman)
- [ ] Release shortlet + rent booking escrow publicly
- [ ] Launch Dev Portal + OAuth system
- [ ] Launch RAG search beta
- [ ] Pitch pilot integrations to banks or proptechs
