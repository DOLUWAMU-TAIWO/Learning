**Chapter 1 Introduction**

1. # **Introduction** {#introduction}

In the digital era, social media platforms have become indispensable tools for political communication, offering politicians, voters, and other stakeholders new avenues for engagement. Unlike traditional media such as newspapers, radio, and television, which rely on centralized content delivery, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp facilitate decentralized, interactive, and real-time communication. In Nigeria, social media has played an increasingly prominent role in elections, shaping political discourse, influencing voter behavior, and also amplifying campaign narratives. However, while these platforms offer opportunities for political mobilization and civic engagement, they have also been implicated in fostering political polarization, spreading misinformation, and undermining democratic processes in Nigeria.  
Political polarization, in this context, refers not only to the deepening division among voters along ethnic, religious, and ideological lines but also to the erosion of democratic deliberation. Social media platforms exacerbate these divisions through algorithm-driven echo chambers, which reinforce pre-existing biases and amplify emotionally charged content while filtering out opposing perspectives. Given Nigeria’s socio-political landscape marked by historical ethnic and regional rivalries these digital dynamics have heightened electoral tensions. This phenomenon was particularly evident in the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections, where platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter functioned both as tools for political mobilization and as vehicles for divisive narratives.  
The 2015 presidential election was a watershed moment in Nigerian democracy, marking a peaceful transfer of power between political parties. Social media played a crucial role, particularly in mobilizing youth and first-time voters. Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign successfully harnessed hashtags like \#Change to galvanize support, while Goodluck Jonathan’s team leveraged Facebook to connect with voters. However, this election cycle also witnessed the early rise of misinformation,with fabricated claims about candidates’ health and corruption scandals contributing to political tensions.  
In the 2019 elections, the influence of social media deepened, with an estimated 27 million Nigerians actively engaging online. WhatsApp emerged as a powerful platform for disseminating political content, often in the form of short videos, memes, and forwarded messages. How- ever, it also became a hub for misinformation, as manipulated videos of electoral violence and inflammatory narratives spread widely. Political polarization intensified, as campaigns increasingly weaponized ethnic and religious sentiments to divide voters. For example, narratives portraying Buhari as favoring northern interests over southern development gained traction, exacerbating regional distrust.  
The 2023 elections further illustrated the complexities of social media’s role in Nigerian democ- racy. While digital platforms enabled real-time political engagement, they also facilitated toxic discourse. Throughout the campaign season, WhatsApp groups and Twitter trends were inundated with unverified information, including accusations of corruption and religious bias. Electoral narratives often framed the elections as an ethnic contest rather than a debate on governance, deepen- ing societal divisions. As voters increasingly relied on social media for political information, the distinction between factual reporting and propaganda blurred, raising critical concerns about the integrity of democratic processes.  
This study investigates the role of social media in political polarization and its implications for Nigeria’s democratic trajectory, using the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections as case stud- ies. By analyzing the interplay between digital platforms, voter behavior, and electoral outcomes, this research seeks to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by social media in an evolving political landscape. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms       through which social media fosters polarization is crucial for developing strategies to promote informed political engagement and safeguard democratic norms in Nigeria.                                                                                         

2. # **Background of the Study** {#background-of-the-study}

   3. The rise of social media has dramatically reshaped political engagement across the world. In Nigeria, where radio, television, and newspapers once dominated political communication, digital platforms have created new ways for politicians, voters, and activists to connect, mobilize, and share information. As of 2023, over 33 million Nigerians actively use social media, making it a powerful force in political campaigns, voter education, and public discourse. However, while social media has improved access to political information and expanded participation, it has also introduced serious challenges, such as the spread of misinformation, divisive rhetoric, and deepening political polarization. These challenges raise concerns about how digital platforms impact

Nigeria’s democracy—especially during elections.

Nigeria’s political history has long been shaped by ethnic, religious, and regional divisions. With over 250 ethnic groups spread across six geopolitical zones, elections in the country are often deeply contested, sometimes leading to tensions and conflicts. Social media has played a double-edged role in this environment:

* On one hand, it has allowed political candidates to speak directly to voters, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers.

  * On the other hand, it has become a tool for spreading false information, reinforcing biases, and deepening divisions along ethnic and religious lines.

The 2015 presidential election marked a turning point in Nigeria’s digital political landscape. Social media played a huge role in voter mobilization, particularly among young people. Muham- madu Buhari’s campaign made strategic use of Twitter hashtags like \#Change, along with Face- book videos and targeted online messaging, to energize supporters. Goodluck Jonathan’s team, in contrast, relied on Facebook to highlight his achievements and connect with voters on a more personal level. However, misinformation also surged during this election. False claims about Jonathan’s alleged ties to Boko Haram and Buhari’s supposed ill health circulated widely, shaping voter perceptions and fueling distrust.  
By 2019, social media had become an even more dominant force in Nigeria’s elections. One of the biggest shifts was the rise of WhatsApp as a key political battleground. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, WhatsApp messages are private and encrypted, making it difficult to track or regulate the content being shared. Political parties took advantage of this by creating thousands of What- sApp groups to spread campaign messages. However, the platform also became a major hub for misinformation:

* False narratives about Atiku Abubakar’s economic policies painted him as a threat to Nige- ria’s stability.

  * Rumors of vote-buying and electoral fraud created confusion and distrust in the electoral process.

    * Manipulated videos and images were widely shared to discredit opponents and stir emotions.

The 2023 presidential election showed just how deeply social media had become embedded in Nigerian politics. For the first time, social media influencers, online activists, and digital grass- roots movements played a major role in shaping public discourse. The campaign of Peter Obi, for example, gained significant traction through youth-driven online mobilization. His support- ers, known as the “Obidients,” leveraged Twitter trends, viral videos, and WhatsApp groups to

spread messages of change, good governance, and accountability. However, as Obi’s popularity grew, so did efforts to discredit him. Ethnic-based attacks framed his candidacy as a regional or religious agenda, fueling tensions between different voting blocs. Meanwhile, manipulated videos and deepfakes—some real, some fabricated—spread rapidly online, fueling post-election disputes and eroding trust in electoral institutions.  
Beyond elections, social media has also played a growing role in Nigerian youth activism. A defining moment was the \#EndSARS movement in 2020, where young Nigerians used Twit- ter, Facebook, and Instagram to organize protests against police brutality, demand reforms, and challenge government narratives. This movement demonstrated the power of digital platforms in mobilizing collective action, and its influence carried over into the 2023 elections, where youth engagement was at an all-time high.  
Despite the positive role of social media in increasing political awareness and participation, it has also contributed to greater polarization and distrust. Scholars such as Sunstein (2018) and Bail et al. (2018) identify three key ways in which digital platforms fuel political divisions:

1. **Algorithmic Amplification**—Social media platforms prioritize emotionally charged con- tent, making divisive political posts more visible.

2. **Selective Exposure**—People gravitate toward news and opinions that reinforce their existing beliefs, limiting exposure to opposing perspectives.

3. **Network Homophily**—Users tend to engage primarily with like-minded individuals, creat- ing echo chambers that deepen ideological divides.

These trends are not unique to Nigeria. Studies from the U.S. (Tucker et al., 2018), Brazil (Resende et al., 2019), and India (Rao et al., 2020\) reveal similar patterns, particularly in the role of WhatsApp as a tool for spreading misinformation and manipulating electoral narratives. However, unlike in Europe, where regulations such as the Digital Services Act (2022) require tech companies to monitor and counter false information, Nigeria lacks a clear framework for regulating social media content (Adekunle, 2022). This regulatory gap allows unchecked misinformation to flourish, making elections more vulnerable to digital manipulation.  
Given these challenges, there is a growing need for policy interventions to reduce the negative impact of social media on Nigeria’s democracy. Potential solutions include:

* Strengthening digital literacy programs to help voters identify misinformation.

  * Partnering with fact-checking organizations like Dubawa and Africa Check to counter false narratives.

  * Developing real-time election monitoring systems to detect and debunk viral misinformation during campaigns.

Without such measures, social media will continue to be both a powerful tool for political engage- ment and a major source of electoral manipulation and division.  
By analyzing the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections, this study seeks to provide a deeper understanding of how social media contributes to political polarization in Nigeria and its broader implications for democratic stability.

4. # **Statement of the Problem** {#statement-of-the-problem}

Social media has redefined political engagement in Nigeria, offering both opportunities and challenges. While it has increased voter participation and made political discourse more accessi- ble, it has also become a breeding ground for misinformation, divisive rhetoric, and digital ma- nipulation. The 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections revealed how social media can shape electoral outcomes—not just by informing the public, but by distorting realities, fueling political polarization, and undermining trust in democratic institutions.  
A core issue is the growing influence of algorithm-driven content curation, which favors sensa- tionalism over accuracy. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp prioritize engagement, meaning that emotionally charged political content—whether true or false—spreads faster than balanced reporting. This has led to a digital ecosystem where misinformation thrives, often rein- forcing ethnic and religious biases. The problem is compounded by the closed nature of WhatsApp, where political propaganda circulates unchecked in private groups, making fact-checking nearly impossible.  
The weaponization of misinformation has escalated in recent election cycles. In 2015, fake reports about Muhammadu Buhari’s health and Goodluck Jonathan’s alleged ties to Boko Haram shaped public sentiment. By 2019, social media was flooded with conspiracy theories, including the widely believed falsehood that Buhari had been replaced by a body double from Sudan. The 2023 elections introduced a more sophisticated layer of disinformation, with deepfake videos and AI-generated propaganda making deception harder to detect. Political actors and interest groups actively exploited these tools to manipulate narratives, disrupt opposition campaigns, and sway undecided voters.  
Another pressing concern is the failure of institutional responses to counter digital electoral manipulation. Despite reforms in the Electoral Act of 2022, Nigeria lacks a structured approach to addressing online disinformation. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been slow to adapt, struggling to control the spread of fake election results and coordinated propaganda. Meanwhile, attempts at regulation—such as the Social Media Bill (2019)—have been

widely criticized as potential tools for government censorship rather than genuine efforts to combat falsehoods. This absence of effective oversight has allowed bot-driven campaigns, paid influencers, and anonymous troll networks to dominate online political spaces with little accountability.  
Beyond misinformation, social media has become a catalyst for political extremism and elec- toral violence. Digital platforms have amplified ethnic and religious fault lines, making elections less about policy and governance and more about identity-based rivalries. False claims of vote sup- pression and rigging have fueled post-election unrest, with social media serving as both a mobiliza- tion tool and an accelerant for conflict. Reports from the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD, 2023\) highlight how inflammatory online rhetoric has contributed to real-world violence, particularly in contested regions.  
Additionally, the monetization of disinformation has made digital propaganda a profitable in- dustry. Political parties hire social media influencers and troll farms to push misleading narratives, discredit opponents, and fabricate public sentiment. This commercialized manipulation of public opinion raises ethical concerns about the authenticity of political discourse in Nigeria, where paid narratives overshadow organic democratic engagement.  
The cumulative impact of these issues is a growing erosion of trust in Nigeria’s electoral sys- tem. Public confidence in INEC, political parties, and even traditional media has declined as social media disinformation becomes more pervasive. If these challenges remain unaddressed, future elections risk becoming battlegrounds for digital deception rather than fair democratic contests.  
This study critically examines the role of social media in shaping political polarization and democratic processes in Nigeria. By focusing on the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections, it seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of how digital platforms influence voter behavior, electoral credibility, and public trust in democratic institutions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial to developing strategies that can protect Nigeria’s democracy from the corrosive effects of misinfor- mation, polarization, and digital manipulation.

5. # **Research Objectives** {#research-objectives}

This study aims to examine the role of social media in political polarization and its impact on democratic processes in Nigeria, focusing on the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections. It seeks to analyze how digital platforms influence voter behavior, campaign strategies, misinforma- tion, and public trust in electoral institutions. Specifically, the study will:

1. Investigate the extent to which social media contributed to political polarization during the 2015, 2019, and 2023 Nigerian presidential elections.

2. Examine the role of Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp in the spread of misinformation, fake

   news, and political propaganda during these elections.

3. Analyze how political campaigns, digital influencers, and online communities shaped voter perceptions and electoral narratives.

4. Assess the impact of social media-driven polarization on public trust in Nigeria’s electoral institutions, particularly INEC.

5. Evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and regulatory measures in addressing social media misinformation and propose actionable recommendations for future elections.

   6. # **Research Questions** {#research-questions}

To achieve the above objectives, this study will address the following research questions:

1. To what extent has social media contributed to political polarization in Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections?

2. How have Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp facilitated the spread of misinformation, fake news, and propaganda in Nigerian elections?

3. What role have political influencers, campaign strategists, and social media algorithms played in shaping voter perceptions and electoral narratives?

4. How has social media-driven polarization affected public trust in Nigeria’s electoral institu- tions, particularly INEC?

5. What regulatory and policy measures can be implemented to address the challenges posed by social media in Nigeria’s electoral process?

   7. # **Research Hypotheses** {#research-hypotheses}

The following hypothesis will guide the research:

* **H**1**:** Social media has significantly increased political polarization in Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections by reinforcing ethnic, religious, and ideological divisions. **H**0**:** Social media has not significantly increased political polarization in Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections.

  * **H**1**:** The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media has significantly influ- enced voter behavior and electoral choices in Nigeria.

  **H**0**:** The spread of misinformation and fake news on social media has not significantly influ- enced voter behavior and electoral choices in Nigeria.

    * **H**1**:** Social media algorithms and political influencers have played a crucial role in shaping political discourse and voter perceptions in Nigerian elections.

  **H**0**:** Social media algorithms and political influencers have not played a crucial role in shap- ing political discourse and voter perceptions in Nigerian elections.

    * **H**1**:** Social media-driven political polarization has significantly weakened public trust in Nigeria’s electoral institutions, particularly INEC.

  **H**0**:** Social media-driven political polarization has not significantly weakened public trust in Nigeria’s electoral institutions, particularly INEC.

  8. # **Significance of the Study** {#significance-of-the-study}

Social media has become a dominant force in shaping political engagement, voter behavior, and campaign strategies in Nigeria. While it has expanded access to political discourse, it has also facilitated misinformation, political polarization, and declining trust in democratic institu- tions. This study is significant because it critically examines the influence of Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp on Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections, highlighting both their potential for democratic participation and their risks to electoral integrity.  
A major contribution of this study is its examination of how social media has altered the flow of political information. Unlike traditional media, where editorial oversight exists, social media plat- forms allow unchecked narratives to spread rapidly, often distorting public perception. In the past three election cycles, false narratives, conspiracy theories, and politically motivated propaganda have played a decisive role in shaping electoral outcomes. This research will assess the mecha- nisms through which misinformation spreads, the factors that make voters susceptible to digital disinformation, and the long-term implications for democratic governance.  
Beyond misinformation, this study addresses the intensification of political polarization through social media interactions. Nigerian politics has historically been influenced by ethnic and religious divisions, but digital platforms have escalated these divides by creating filter bubbles where users are repeatedly exposed to content that reinforces pre-existing biases. Election periods have wit- nessed a surge in ethnic-based political hostility, which in turn has heightened political intolerance and electoral tensions. By analyzing these patterns, the research will provide insights into how

online discourse fuels division and what strategies can be employed to counter digital tribalism in Nigerian politics.  
This study is particularly relevant for policymakers and electoral regulators who face grow- ing challenges in managing digital election-related misinformation. Although the Electoral Act of 2022 introduced reforms aimed at improving electoral transparency, it did not include clear mechanisms for regulating social media’s role in election manipulation. The Independent Na- tional Electoral Commission (INEC) has struggled to contain the spread of fake election results and coordinated digital propaganda, leading to widespread skepticism about election credibility. Meanwhile, legislative attempts to introduce social media regulations have been met with resis- tance due to fears of government overreach. This study will identify policy gaps and propose regulatory solutions that balance free speech with electoral integrity.  
The findings will also be beneficial to political parties and campaign strategists, who increas- ingly rely on digital tools to mobilize support. While social media offers unprecedented access to voters, it also creates risks when campaigns engage in deceptive practices such as bot-driven propaganda, deepfake videos, and paid misinformation networks. The research will explore how political actors use digital platforms to shape voter sentiment and provide recommendations on ethical digital campaign strategies that foster engagement without deepening societal divides.  
Additionally, this study holds practical significance for fact-checking organizations, journalists, and digital literacy advocates. Independent verification platforms such as Dubawa and Africa Check have made efforts to counter political misinformation, but the scale and speed of false information dissemination far outpaces fact-checking initiatives. This research will assess the effectiveness of current fact-checking mechanisms and propose innovative approaches to combat misinformation more efficiently, especially in rural communities where digital literacy levels are lower.  
Finally, this study contributes to Nigeria’s broader democratic development by addressing how social media influences public trust in electoral institutions. Trust is a cornerstone of democracy, and when voters perceive elections as manipulated through disinformation, confidence in the po- litical system declines. If unchecked, these trends could lead to greater political apathy, increased electoral violence, and long-term instability. By analyzing the 2015, 2019, and 2023 elections, this study will provide actionable insights into how Nigeria can safeguard its democratic institutions in the digital age.

9. # **Scope and Limitation of the Study** {#scope-and-limitation-of-the-study}

**Scope of the Study**

The research focuses on how social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp have shaped voter perceptions, political campaigns, and trust in Nigeria’s electoral process. It ex- amines how misinformation, fake news, and propaganda have fueled political divisions and how social media algorithms have created echo chambers that reinforce biases. The study also consid- ers how different groups, including Nigeria’s election body (INEC), political parties, fact-checking organizations, and social media platforms, have responded to the spread of misinformation and dig- ital manipulation during elections. It assesses the effectiveness of existing regulations in managing the influence of social media on elections and explores whether more policies are needed to protect voters from being misled by false information.

**Limitations of the Study**

* **Challenges in Measuring Direct Social Media Influence:** Voter decisions are influenced by multiple factors, making it difficult to isolate the exact impact of social media on election outcomes. Some voters may be unaware of how digital campaigns shape their perceptions, leading to biased self-reported survey responses.

  * **Data Availability and Accessibility:** Social media companies do not publicly release full engagement analytics, limiting the study’s ability to track exact voter influence. WhatsApp messages are encrypted, making it impossible to fully trace the spread of misinformation in private groups.

    * **Content Manipulation and Data Deletion:** Political actors often delete misleading posts after elections, making it difficult to track historical misinformation campaigns. Some viral political content is not archived, meaning key digital evidence may be missing.

    * **Regulatory and Ethical Challenges:** Nigeria lacks a clear digital regulatory framework for elections, making it difficult to measure institutional responses to online manipulation. Concerns over censorship and free speech have made government regulation of social media controversial.

    * **Demographic Representation and Digital Divide:** The study may overrepresent urban, educated, and younger voters who are more active on social media, while rural, low-income, and older voters who rely on traditional media may be underrepresented. Internet penetration is uneven across Nigeria, meaning social media’s influence varies by region.

  10. # **Chapterization** {#chapterization}

4. #### **Chapter Four: Data Presentation and Analysis**

   This chapter presents the research findings by systematically analyzing the data collected from Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 elections. It examines the extent to which misinfor- mation and propaganda on social media influenced voter perceptions and electoral decision- making. The role of political influencers, bot-driven campaigns, and algorithm-driven con- tent is explored. The chapter also assesses public trust in electoral institutions and provides a comparative analysis of social media’s evolving impact.

5. #### **Chapter Five: Summary, Conclusion, and Recommendations**

   The final chapter summarizes the key findings, draws conclusions about social media’s im- pact on political polarization and democratic processes, and provides policy recommenda- tions. It discusses the broader implications of digital political engagement and identifies gaps in the existing literature, suggesting areas for future research.

   11. # **Definition of Terms** {#definition-of-terms}

For clarity and academic precision, the following key terms are conceptualized based on gen- erally accepted definitions in political science, media studies, and electoral governance. These definitions provide a structured framework for analyzing the role of social media in political polar- ization and democratic processes during Nigeria’s 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections.

**Social Media**

Social media refers to web-based platforms that enable users to create, share, and engage with content in real time. It facilitates public discourse, political mobilization, and rapid information dissemination. According to Kaplan and Haenlein (2010), social media encompasses applications that allow for the exchange of user-generated content through interactive digital communication technologies. In this study, social media specifically refers to platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, which have been central to election-related discussions, voter mobilization, and the spread of misinformation in Nigeria.

**Political Polarization**

Political polarization is the process by which public opinion divides into distinct ideological extremes, reducing the space for political compromise and increasing hostility between opposing groups. Fiorina and Abrams (2008) define it as the growing ideological distance between polit- ical actors and their supporters. In the Nigerian context, this polarization is reinforced by social media algorithms, which create echo chambers where users are exposed primarily to content that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, thereby fueling ethnic, religious, and regional divides during elections.

**Misinformation**

Misinformation is false or misleading information that is shared, regardless of intent, and is often mistaken as fact by the public. According to Wardle and Derakhshan (2017), misinformation refers to inaccurate content that spreads widely due to a lack of verification rather than deliberate deception. This study examines how misinformation circulated on social media during Nigerian elections, shaping voter perceptions and public trust in electoral institutions.

**Disinformation**

Disinformation is intentionally false or manipulated information designed to deceive the pub- lic and influence political outcomes. Unlike misinformation, which may be spread unintentionally, disinformation is deliberately crafted to mislead. The European Commission (2018) defines it as “verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented, and disseminated for eco- nomic gain or to intentionally deceive the public.” In Nigeria’s elections, disinformation has been used as a tool for political propaganda, aimed at discrediting opponents and influencing voter be- havior.

**Fake News**

Fake news refers to fabricated information presented as legitimate journalism with the intent to mislead audiences. According to Allcott and Gentzkow (2017), fake news consists of “news articles that are intentionally and verifiably false, and that could mislead readers.” In the Nigerian political context, fake news has been widely shared on social media, including doctored images, manipulated videos, and fabricated election results—all of which have contributed to voter misin- formation and political distrust.

**Echo Chambers**

An echo chamber is a digital environment in which individuals are primarily exposed to in- formation that reinforces their existing beliefs, thereby limiting exposure to opposing viewpoints. Sunstein (2001) defines echo chambers as spaces where algorithm-driven content selection creates ideological isolation, making political discourse more extreme. In Nigerian elections, social media platforms have contributed to the formation of echo chambers, where voters consume only one- sided political narratives, thereby increasing polarization and reducing the potential for objective discussion.

**Algorithmic Bias**

Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic favoring of certain types of content over others due to the way social media algorithms prioritize engagement, often amplifying divisive or sensational content. According to Noble (2018), algorithmic bias occurs when machine-learning systems re- inforce existing prejudices through content curation. In this study, algorithmic bias is examined in the context of how social media platforms promote politically charged and polarizing content, thereby shaping public discourse during elections.

**Political Propaganda**

Political propaganda is the strategic use of information—often biased or misleading—to influ- ence public opinion and advance a specific political agenda. According to Jowett and O’Donnell (2018), propaganda is “the deliberate and systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognition, and direct behavior to achieve a political response.” In Nigerian elections, political pro- paganda has been widely disseminated through social media campaigns, false endorsements, and strategically framed political narratives.

**Bot-Driven Campaigns**

A bot-driven campaign refers to the use of automated software programs (bots) to amplify po- litical messages, create artificial trends, and manipulate public opinion on social media. According to Ferrara et al. (2016), social bots are “automated accounts designed to mimic human behavior and engage in large-scale information dissemination.” This study examines how bot-driven cam- paigns have been used in Nigeria to spread propaganda, attack political opponents, and create the illusion of widespread support for candidates.

**Digital Political Influencers**

Digital political influencers are individuals who use their social media platforms to shape public opinion, promote political candidates, and influence voter decisions. According to Khamis et al. (2017), influencers are “individuals who have built a following in a particular niche and are able to shape public attitudes through digital engagement.” In Nigerian elections, political influencers have played a key role in mobilizing voters, spreading campaign messages, and, in some cases, perpetuating misinformation.

**Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)**

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is Nigeria’s electoral management body responsible for conducting and regulating elections. Established under the 1999 Constitu- tion of Nigeria, INEC oversees voter registration, election administration, and the enforcement of electoral laws. This study examines how public trust in INEC has been affected by social media narratives, misinformation, and allegations of electoral misconduct.

**Electoral Integrity**

Electoral integrity refers to the degree to which an election is conducted in a free, fair, and trans- parent manner, ensuring that all political actors and voters have confidence in the process. Accord- ing to Norris (2014), electoral integrity is achieved when elections meet international democratic standards for transparency, inclusiveness, and accountability. In this study, electoral integrity is an- alyzed in relation to social media’s role in either enhancing or undermining public trust in Nigeria’s democratic process.

**Chapter 2**

**Literature Review and Theoretical framework**

1. **Preamble**

This chapter provides a critical review of literature on the role of social media in Nigeria’s elections. It examines key themes such as political communication, misinformation, electoral integrity, and political polarization. The conceptual framework defines and contextualizes these issues, while the theoretical framework applies relevant political communication theories to explain their impact. Through an analysis of existing studies, the chapter highlights the opportunities and challenges posed by social media in shaping Nigeria’s democratic process.

2. **Conceptual Framework**

   1. **Social Media as a Tool**

Social media has emerged as a powerful force in modern political engagement, reshaping how political actors communicate, how voters receive information, and how elections are conducted (Howard & Hussain, 2013). In Nigeria, where traditional media once dominated political dis- course, the rise of digital platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and TikTok has created new opportunities for political mobilization, grassroots activism, and real-time electoral partic- ipation (Okoro & Nwafor, 2013). However, the decentralized nature of social media has also given rise to misinformation, political propaganda, and increased political polarization (Ibrahim & Adamu, 2020). Understanding these dynamics requires a comprehensive examination of social media’s impact on political communication, electoral integrity, public trust, and political polariza- tion—particularly within the context of Nigeria’s elections.

2. **The Double-Edged Nature of Social Media in Political Communication**

Social media has transformed political communication by allowing direct engagement between politicians and the electorate. Unlike traditional media, which operates through editorial control and journalistic oversight, digital platforms provide a space where political actors can bypass in- termediaries and communicate directly with citizens (Diamond, 2010). This shift significantly altered Nigeria’s electoral landscape, as seen in the 2015 presidential election when Buhari’s cam- paign used Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp to counter PDP’s dominance in traditional media (Smyth & Best, 2019). Hashtags such as \#GMB15 and \#Change mobilized young voters, demon- strating how social media can serve as a tool for political engagement and influence. However, the unregulated nature of social media also makes it a breeding ground for misinformation and political manipulation (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). The 2019 elections witnessed coordinated disinforma- tion campaigns—with paid influencers, bots, and AI-driven propaganda shaping public perception (Ajibola, 2021). A widely circulated false claim suggested that Atiku Abubakar was not a Nigerian citizen, sparking controversy despite subsequent debunking by fact-checkers (BBC Reality Check, 2019). The 2023 elections further demonstrated social media’s capacity for electoral influence, as Peter Obi’s Obidient Movement effectively mobilized supporters through Twitter Spaces and WhatsApp groups (Campbell, 2023), even as deepfake videos and algorithm-driven misinforma- tion complicated voter decision-making (Gwagwa et al., 2023).

3. **Social Media’s Impact on Electoral Integrity and Public Trust**

Electoral integrity is a cornerstone of democratic governance, ensuring that elections are con- ducted in a fair, transparent, and credible manner (Norris, 2014). Public trust in electoral institu- tions—particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)—is vital for maintain- ing confidence in the democratic process (Oni et al., 2013). Social media has played a dual role in this context. On the positive side, it has enhanced election monitoring and voter awareness: during the 2015 elections, citizens used Twitter and Facebook to report electoral malpractices (Omede, 2019), and by 2023, initiatives such as \#NigeriaDecides and real-time updates via Twitter Spaces further bolstered transparency (Quartz Africa, 2023). On the negative side, rapid dissemination of misinformation regarding election results, voter suppression, and fraud has eroded public trust (Ak- inwale, 2023). For example, in 2019 a viral rumor claimed that INEC’s servers had been hacked, casting doubt on official results (Premium Times, 2019), while in 2023, manipulated exit polls and fake forecasts circulated via WhatsApp and Twitter (BBC Monitoring, 2023). Although fact- checking organizations like Dubawa and Africa Check have attempted to counter false narratives, misinformation often spreads too quickly (Ayoade, 2021).

4. **How Social Media Fuels Political Polarization in Nigeria**

Political polarization refers to the growing ideological divide between opposing political fac- tions, reducing opportunities for dialogue and increasing hostility (Iyengar et al., 2019). Social media exacerbates this phenomenon by creating digital echo chambers, where individuals primar- ily encounter content that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs (Pariser, 2011). Algorithm-driven content curation further deepens these divides by limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Nige- ria’s electoral landscape, already shaped by ethnic and regional affiliations, has seen these divisions intensified. In the 2019 elections, for instance, Buhari’s supporters dominated Northern WhatsApp groups while Atiku Abubakar’s campaign gained momentum in Southern digital spaces (Obadare, 2020). By 2023, online debates had become even more polarized—often devolving into digital battles framed along ethnic and regional lines—which increases political hostility and the risk of post-election violence (Okonkwo, 2023).

5. **Social Media Regulation and Electoral Governance**

Despite its growing influence in Nigeria’s electoral process, the country lacks comprehensive legal frameworks to regulate digital political campaigns (Akande & Olowu, 2020). Unlike tradi- tional media, which is subject to national broadcasting regulations, digital platforms operate with minimal oversight. The absence of clear guidelines on digital political advertising, misinforma- tion control, and online mobilization has allowed political actors to exploit social media without accountability. Efforts such as the Social Media Bill of 2019 have faced opposition over fears of government overreach and restrictions on free speech (Sahara Reporters, 2019). Furthermore, the encryption of platforms like WhatsApp complicates efforts to track and counter the spread of mis- information (Gwagwa & Schoemaker, 2021). There is an urgent need for policies that balance free expression with effective regulation of digital electioneering.

6. **Bots, Computational Propaganda, and Electoral Manipulation**

The rise of computational propaganda—using automated digital strategies to manipulate public opinion—has become a significant concern in Nigeria’s electoral process. Political bots, which are automated accounts designed to mimic human behavior, are used to amplify political messages, shape narratives, and sway voter perceptions (Ferrara et al., 2016). During the 2019 elections, bot- driven campaigns artificially inflated support for certain candidates on Twitter while suppressing dissenting voices. In the 2023 elections, AI-powered bots further spread misinformation, inun- dated opposition channels, and attacked fact-checking organizations. These practices underscore the urgent need for improved social media regulation and ethical guidelines for digital political

advertising.

7. **Democratic Processes in Nigeria and the Role of Social Media**

Democratic processes encompass the structures and mechanisms that enable citizen participa- tion, political representation, and accountability. In Nigeria, these processes have evolved through elections, civic engagement, public discourse, and institutional checks and balances. Social media has reshaped these dynamics by broadening access to political information and amplifying citizen voices. For example, during the 2015 elections, social media was pivotal in engaging young vot- ers—a trend that continued with movements like the Obidient Movement in 2023 (Aduloju, 2016; Benaiah & Osuntoki, 2024). Furthermore, platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp have enabled direct interactions between political actors and the electorate, fostering increased po- litical mobilization. The \#EndSARS protests also demonstrated how digital platforms can drive political activism and influence policy decisions (Bello et al., 2023). Nevertheless, challenges persist as the rapid spread of misinformation and algorithm-driven echo chambers can distort pub- lic perception and deepen polarization (Ajaegbu & Ajaegbu, 2024; Ademosu & Oyeleye, 2019; Ewang, 2019).

8. **Ways in Which Social Media Influences Democratic Practices in Nige- ria**

Social media platforms have enhanced democratic engagement in Nigeria by facilitating polit- ical participation, promoting transparency, and enabling social mobilization. For instance, during the 2015 elections, previously passive youth became actively engaged through social media, partic- ipating in both constructive and critical political debates (Aduloju, 2016). Moreover, coordinated use of digital platforms has proven effective for election monitoring, thereby positively influencing public perceptions of electoral integrity (Smyth & Best, 2019).

9. **Ways in Which Social Media Negatively Influences Democratic Prac- tices in Nigeria**

Despite its benefits, social media also poses significant risks to Nigeria’s democratic practices. The spread of misinformation, coupled with potential misuse through propaganda, cyberbullying, and harassment, can escalate political tensions and undermine democratic processes. Studies have shown that online discussions often become highly polarized, deepening societal divisions (Ade- mosu & Oyeleye, 2019). Additionally, misuse of social media can create conditions conducive to

electoral violence and ethnic strife, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory policies (Olojede, 2024).

10. **The Nexus Between Social Media and Polarization in Nigerian Democ- racy**

Social media plays a critical role in amplifying political polarization by fostering divisive rhetoric and fragmenting the public sphere. Research indicates that online political discussions frequently devolve into extreme, polarized debates (Ademosu & Oyeleye, 2019). This polariza- tion is further intensified by the echo chamber effect, in which algorithm-driven content reinforces pre-existing biases. Moreover, the unchecked spread of misinformation and hate speech on digital platforms exacerbates ethnic tensions and deepens political divides (Olojede, 2024). These find- ings highlight the urgent need for regulatory measures to govern social media usage and ensure accountability in digital political discourse.

3. **Theoretical Framework**

The influence of social media on democratic practices in Nigeria is best understood through key political communication theories. This study adopts three principal theories:

1. **Agenda-Setting Theory**

Agenda-setting theory (McCombs & Shaw, 1972\) explains how media influences which issues dominate public discourse. Social media disrupts traditional gatekeeping by enabling citizens and political actors to set the political agenda. In Nigeria, online movements such as \#EndSARS and election-related discussions have driven public debates, sometimes sidelining mainstream media narratives. However, this decentralized agenda-setting also permits misinformation to shape voter perceptions and impact electoral outcomes.

2. ## **Framing Theory** {#framing-theory}

Framing theory (Entman, 1993\) examines how political messages are structured to influence public interpretation. In Nigerian elections, candidates and their supporters use social media to frame narratives that either promote their campaign promises or discredit opponents. Ethnic and religious framing is particularly evident—for example, during the 2019 elections, Atiku Abubakar was framed as a non-Nigerian to undermine his legitimacy. Similarly, in 2023, candidates were

portrayed in ways that reinforced pre-existing voter biases, thereby shaping public opinion along partisan lines.

3. ## **Selective Exposure Theory** {#selective-exposure-theory}

Selective exposure theory (Sunstein, 2001\) posits that individuals tend to engage with infor- mation that aligns with their pre-existing beliefs, thereby reinforcing political polarization. In Nigeria, social media users often operate within digital echo chambers, where algorithm-driven content limits exposure to diverse perspectives. This phenomenon deepens ideological divides and reduces opportunities for consensus in political discourse.

4. # **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

Social media has become a central force in Nigeria’s electoral process, offering new avenues for political engagement, voter education, and real-time election monitoring. However, its role in spreading misinformation, deepening political polarization, and enabling electoral manipulation poses significant challenges to democratic governance. The evolving nature of digital election- eering necessitates continuous scholarly inquiry and the development of regulatory strategies that mitigate its negative effects while enhancing its democratic potential.

**Chapter 3 Research Methodology**

1. # **Introduction** {#introduction-1}

Research methodology provides the systematic framework for collecting, analyzing, and in- terpreting data, ensuring that findings are credible and replicable (Creswell, 2014). According to Bhattacherjee (2012), a sound methodology is essential for producing reliable knowledge and addressing the research problem effectively. This chapter outlines the methods employed to inves- tigate how social media influences democratic practices in Nigeria, particularly during the 2015, 2019, and 2023 presidential elections.

2. # **Methodology of Research** {#methodology-of-research}

The methodology of research refers to the overall approach that guides how data will be col- lected, analyzed, and interpreted to answer the research questions and achieve the study objectives. It provides a clear plan for gathering information and analyzing findings to ensure that the research is systematic, credible, and academically sound.  
This study seeks to examine how social media contributes to political polarization during Nige- rian presidential elections. To achieve this, both primary and secondary data collection methods will be employed. Primary data will be obtained through structured questionnaires distributed to social media users and political stakeholders. The questionnaire is chosen because it allows for standardized responses, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns in social media behavior and political opinions. The questionnaire will be divided into sections, covering respondents’ de- mographics, their social media usage patterns, experiences with political debates online, and views on how digital platforms fuel polarization.  
Responses will be measured using a five-point Likert scale, which offers a range of options from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. This method is selected because it simplifies the anal-

ysis of attitudes and opinions, making it easier to identify patterns in how social media shapes political divisions.  
To ensure the validity and reliability of the research instruments, expert opinions will be sought from political science scholars, who will review the questionnaire for clarity and relevance. A pilot study will also be conducted with a small group of respondents to test the consistency and reliability of the questions. Feedback from the pilot test will guide adjustments to eliminate ambiguity and improve the clarity of the questionnaire.

3. # **Research Design** {#research-design}

Research design refers to the specific framework chosen for conducting the study, guiding the collection and analysis of data to achieve the research objectives (Creswell, 2018). It is the structured plan that ensures the research process is organized, systematic, and aligned with the study’s goals.  
For this study, a mixed-method research design is selected, combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. This design is chosen because it allows the researcher to:

* Quantify trends through surveys while gaining in-depth insights through interviews.

  * Compare and validate findings from different sources (triangulation).

The research design is broken down as follows:

* **Quantitative Approach (Survey):** A structured questionnaire will be distributed to a sample of Nigerian social media users, gathering measurable data on their experiences with political discourse online.

  * **Qualitative Approach (Interviews):** Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with political analysts, journalists, and social media influencers to gather expert opinions on how social media has fueled polarization during elections.

The mixed-method design is suitable for this study because it captures both statistical trends and personal experiences, providing a fuller understanding of social media’s role in political po- larization. It allows for data triangulation, ensuring more credible and reliable results. It aligns with the research objectives by addressing both the ”how” (quantitative patterns) and the ”why” (qualitative insights) behind social media polarization.  
In summary, the mixed-method design ensures that the research is structured, comprehensive, and suitable for addressing all research questions while providing a rich analysis of social media’s impact on political polarization in Nigeria.

4. # **Study Population** {#study-population}

The study population refers to the entire group of individuals from whom relevant data will be collected to address the research questions. For this research, the population consists of individuals who are directly involved in political discussions and engagements on social media during the Nigerian presidential elections of 2015, 2019, and 2023\.  
The population for this study includes:

* Nigerian social media users, particularly those who actively participate in political debates on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, where political conversations and trends are most visible.

  * Youth and students from higher institutions, as they represent a large demographic of online political participants and are often key drivers of digital political movements.

    * Political observers and digital campaign strategists who are familiar with how social media platforms have been used to promote candidates, spread political narratives, and drive public opinion during election periods.

  5. # **Sampling Techniques and Sample Size** {#sampling-techniques-and-sample-size}

Sampling refers to the process of selecting a representative group from the study population to participate in the research. It ensures that the findings are reliable and applicable to the broader population. This section explains the techniques used to select respondents and how the sample size was determined.  
For this study, the purposive sampling technique is employed. Purposive sampling, also known as judgmental sampling, involves selecting participants based on their knowledge, experience, and relevance to the research topic. This technique is appropriate because the study focuses on individuals who have direct experience with political discussions on social media during the 2015, 2019, and 2023 Nigerian presidential elections.  
The study population includes:

* Nigerian social media users who actively engage in political discussions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp, where election narratives and trends are shaped.

  * Students and youths, as they are major drivers of online political movements.

    * Political analysts and digital campaign strategists, who understand how social media has been used to influence public opinion and shape political discourse.

**Sample Size and Calculation**

The sample size is determined using the Taro Yamane formula, which is widely used for cal- culating sample sizes when the population size is large or unknown. The formula is:

Where:

* *n* \= Sample size

  * *N* \= Estimated population size

  *N*

*n* \= 1 \+ *N* (*e*)2

* *e* \= Margin of error (usually 0.08 for social science research)

Since the exact population of social media users engaged in political discussions is unknown, the estimated population size is taken as 10,000, which is a reasonable estimate based on active engagement during election periods.  
Using the Taro Yamane formula:

10000

10000

10000

10000  
*n* \= 1 \+ 10000(0*.*08\)2 \= 1 \+ 10000(0*.*0064\) \= 1 \+ 64 \=

Thus, approximately 150 respondents will be targeted.  
*≈* 153*.*85  
65

**Distribution of Sample Size**

Out of the 150 respondents, the sample is distributed as follows to ensure diversity and rele- vance to the research objectives:

* 100 social media users (students, youths, and active political participants): Selected through purposive sampling from social platforms and university networks.

  * 50 political analysts, journalists, and digital campaign strategists: Selected based on their professional experience with social media’s role in elections.

#### **Inclusion Criteria:**

* Must have actively engaged in political discussions on social media during the 2015, 2019, or 2023 elections.

  * Must be 18 years or older.

    * Willing to participate and share their opinions.

#### **Exclusion Criteria:**

* Individuals who have never used social media for political engagement.

  * Respondents unwilling to participate or complete the questionnaire.

  6. # **Instrument for Data Collection** {#instrument-for-data-collection}

The instrument for data collection refers to the tools or methods used to gather information from respondents to answer the research questions and meet the study objectives. For this research, structured questionnaires will be used as the primary instrument for data collection.  
The structured questionnaire is chosen because it allows for the collection of standardized responses, making it easier to analyze trends, compare opinions, and draw conclusions. This method is appropriate for gathering information from a large number of respondents in a short time. Additionally, the use of questionnaires provides respondents with anonymity, which can encourage them to express their views honestly.  
The questionnaire will be divided into four sections, each designed to address specific research questions:

* **Section A: Demographic Information** – This section will collect background information about the respondents, including their age, gender, educational level, and frequency of social media use.

  * **Section B: Social Media Usage and Political Participation** – This section will focus on re- spondents’ engagement with social media platforms during election periods. It will include questions on platforms most frequently used (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp), partici- pation in online political debates or trends, and use of hashtags or political movements (e.g., \#EndSARS, \#PVCNow, \#Buhari2023, \#ObidientMovement).

    * **Section C: Impact of Social Media on Political Polarization** – This section will explore respondents’ perceptions of how social media influences political divisions. Questions will address exposure to political misinformation or fake news, experiences with online argu- ments or conflicts over political issues, and views on whether social media promotes political bias or echo chambers.

    * **Section D: Public Perception of Social Media’s Role in Elections** – This section will assess opinions on how social media affects political outcomes and democratic participation,

  including whether social media amplifies political propaganda, the impact of influencers and celebrities on voter choices, and trust in information shared on social platforms compared to traditional media.

**Questionnaire Format:** The questionnaire will use a Five-Point Likert Scale for most ques- tions (Strongly Agree, Agree, Undecided, Disagree, Strongly Disagree), facilitating the quantifi- cation of respondents’ opinions.  
**Mode of Administration:** The questionnaire will be administered via Google Forms to reach a wider audience, especially social media users.

7. # **Validity of the Instrument** {#validity-of-the-instrument}

Validity refers to the extent to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure. It ensures that the data collected accurately reflects the research objectives and provides meaningful results (Kumar, 2019). To ensure the validity of the questionnaire used in this study:

* **Face Validity:** The questionnaire will be pilot-tested with a small group of 10 respondents (students and social media users) to ensure clarity and relevance. Any confusing or ambigu- ous questions will be revised based on their feedback.

  * **Expert Review:** The questionnaire will be evaluated by the project supervisor and other academic staff in the political science department to ensure it is well-structured and suitable for the research.

  8. # **Reliability of the Instrument** {#reliability-of-the-instrument}

Reliability refers to the ability of the research instrument to produce consistent results when applied repeatedly under the same conditions. It ensures that the data collected is stable, depend- able, and replicable (Kumar, 2019). For this study, the test-retest method will be used to establish the reliability of the questionnaire.

9. # **Method of Data Collection** {#method-of-data-collection}

The method of data collection refers to the process and tools used to gather information from respondents to answer the research questions and achieve the study objectives. In this research, the primary source of data collection will be a structured questionnaire, which is widely used for collecting quantitative data from a large group of people. The questionnaire is selected because

it allows for the collection of standardized responses, making it easier to analyze trends and draw meaningful conclusions.  
The questionnaire will include both close-ended and Likert scale questions to capture respon- dents’ opinions on how social media influences political polarization. It will be divided into four sections (A, B, C, and D) as described above. To collect responses, the questionnaire will be ad- ministered via Google Forms. The questionnaire will be shared on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook to ensure that the respondents are part of the target popula- tion. The researcher will personally administer the questionnaire and provide clear instructions to ensure respondents understand the questions. Confidentiality and anonymity will be assured, and respondents will be informed that their responses are for academic purposes only.

10. # **Method of Data Analysis and Interpretation** {#method-of-data-analysis-and-interpretation}

The method of data analysis refers to the process of organizing, summarizing, and interpreting the collected data to answer the research questions and achieve the study objectives. Data gathered through the questionnaires will be analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. The responses will be entered into a statistical software program (such as SPSS or Excel) for analysis. Descriptive statistics, including percentages, frequencies, and mean scores, will be used to summarize the data and present trends observed among respondents. The results will be displayed using tables and charts to make the findings clear and easy to interpret.
