# ZenNest: Strategic Monetization and Value Capture Framework

---

## 1. Vision
**ZenNest is the ImmoScout24 of Nigeria**—a digital rental marketplace with SaaS tools for landlords, AI-driven search for tenants, and a fintech layer for seamless transactions. It enables a modern, data-enriched, secure rental experience in underserved cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan.

---

## 2. Core Problem Solved
- **Lack of trust** in Nigerian rental platforms due to fraud, poor listings, and informal processes.
- **Fragmented landlord operations**—manual lease signing, no engagement tracking, no automation.
- **Inefficient lead-to-rent pipeline**, often finalized off-platform with no accountability or insight.
